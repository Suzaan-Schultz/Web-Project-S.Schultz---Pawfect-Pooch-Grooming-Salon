# Web-Project-S.Schultz---Pawfect-Pooch-Grooming-Salon
This is my flask app - created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and SQLite3.


# Flask App

This flask app demonstrates a full stack web development using both front end (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and back end development (Python and SQLite3).

I created a website for a local dog groomer by using some of their existing content on Facebook and Whatsapp. 

I also added a login form, registration form and an appointments form through the use of Python and an SQL database.
